Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shivram, an amateur computer programmer and . I've been working with computers for
over three years, and am proficient in Python and Rust.

I'm interested in low-level programming and compiler design. I'm also a big fan of
free and open-source software, and simple websites.

Outside of programming, I also like to make animated 3D scenes in
[Blender][blender]. I'm also a voracious reader.

I've worked on many interesting projects, such as a
[data serialization format][twine], and a [math expression parser][mathrs]. I'm
currently working on [RISP][risp], a LISP-like interpreted programming language.

If you'd like to reach out, you can contact me through [Discord][discord].
