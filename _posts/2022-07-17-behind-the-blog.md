title: Behind the Blog
---

I made a blog. I probably don't need one, but I like having one.
It compels me to write, and also gives me a place to express my
opinions.

# Tech Rundown

Most blogs, including mine, use a static site generator. I use
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Conveniently, it also has
built-in support for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com),
where I host the site.

The theme used on the site is built from scratch. [Roboto Slab][robotoslab]
is used for headings, and [Source Serif Pro][sourceserifpro]
everywhere else. JavaScript is only used for the theme switcher.

The base HTML, CSS and fonts amount to around 40 KB per page
(uncompressed). GitHub Pages has GZip but this doesn't help
much. It's not too heavy, but it's not the lightest site either.

# What I'll post

I haven't really made my mind on what I want to share. So my
posts will probably be very random and disconnected.

I might end up posing about the projects I want to work on, or
even about the things that pique my interest. I'm terrible at
writing long form content, so expect my articles to be pretty short.

And that's it. If you want to suggest an idea for an article,
feel free to contact me.
